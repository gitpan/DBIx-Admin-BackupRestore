Revision history for Perl extension DBIx::Admin::BackupRestore.

1.03  Tue Sep 14 13:39:00 2004
	- A new option has been added to the constructor: fiddle_timestamp.
		The default value of the option is 1, so the module behaves as it did before.
		If you call new(fiddle_timestamp => 0), we skip the documented process of fiddling
		values of type timestamp during a call to restore(), so that the data being restored
		is inserted as-is. This option was requested by Daniel Santamaria.

1.02  Thu Aug 26 12:57:00 2004
	- A new parameter has been added to the constructor: skip_tables.
		If new is called as new(skip_tables => ['some_table_name']), the restore phase
		does not restore the tables named in the call to new().
		This option is designed to work with CGI scripts using the module CGI::Sessions.
		Now, the CGI script can run with the current CGI::Session data, and stale
		CGI::Session data is not restored from the XML file.
		This parameter is optional. It defaults to [].

1.01  Mon Jul 19 14:43:00 2004
	- Change Makefile.PL to coexist with Module::Build

1.00  Tue Jan 22 12:37:29 2004
	- Original version
