Revision history for Perl extension DBIx::Admin::BackupRestore.

1.02  Thu Aug 26 12:57:00 2004
	- A new parameter has been added to the constructor: skip_tables.
		If new is called as new(skip_tables => ['some_table_name']), the restore phase
		does not restore the tables named in the call to new().
		This option is designed to work with CGI scripts using the module CGI::Sessions.
		Now, the CGI script can run with the current CGI::Session data, and stale
		CGI::Session data is not restored from the XML file.
		This parameter is optional. It defaults to [].
